## CamVid Dataset

The Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) is a collection of over ten minutes of high-quality 30Hz footage with object class semantic labels at 1 Hz and in part, 15 Hz. Each pixel is associated with one of 32 classes.

The CamVid dataset supported here is a 12 class version that casn be downloaded from this repository: [camvid](https://github.com/davidtvs/camvid). The split between train, validation, and testing datasets mirrors the one used on [SegNet](https://github.com/alexgkendall/SegNet-Tutorial/tree/master/CamVid).

Detailed information about the CamVid dataset can be found [here](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/).
